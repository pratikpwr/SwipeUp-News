# SwipeUp News
Flutter News App. Used NewsAPI.org APIs for news.
The app has features like Searching Topics, Reading News from Different Categories and Specific Sources.
The app also has a feature to read the detailed news on a website, for this I used the webView plugin provided by flutter packages.
Used onboarding screens to explain how to use the App.
## App Features
Stay Updated in short by reading Top news in Short Descriptions.
This app Provides News From Multiple news Sources and Latest Top news.
As the name suggests just Swipe Up to Read more news. Swipe left to Read detailed news, and Swipe Right to use DashBoard to search News, Read News from Multiple news Sources, and Specific News based on Different Categories.
Use Dark mode for More Efficient Reading.
